        For the past six years I have been working as an Engineer and it has
        been an adventure, however, something has been missing.. I have always
        wanted to learn programming and build Websites and Applications. I have
        always had an interest in working for myself and on my own time.

        WELL HERE I AM! Finally taking the leap and branching out on my own.
